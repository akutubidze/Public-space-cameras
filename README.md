# Public-space-cameras

Here is an interactive map of indoor and outdoor public spaces with surveillance cameras that have been installed nearby, either by the city or by private owners in Manhatan.

The names of public space are listed on the left side of the screen. This list of names has been generated by creating objects with properties and their values including location(longitude/latitude) name(title) time(hours of operation. 

L.circle and L.marker methods were used to create red circles and markers for each location with the pop-up menu showing appropriate information.

You can click on each name on the list. With the help of jQuery library and the functions forEach and .append, it will zoom to the appropriate location showing the information and location of survailance cameras with blue circles which I manually created using geojson.io, downloading separate geojson file and adding as a separate layer using Axios while hosting it on my personal Github account.

The same method was used to add a subway layer, using external geojson file hosted on third part Github account(Prof.Will Field's account).

Two more tile layers - Toner and Terrain tile maps from maps.stamen.com were also added using L.tileLayer method. L.control function was used to create toggle menue on upper right corner of the map.
